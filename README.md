This repository contains the source code for an AI-powered legal assistant designed to review, validate, and help prepare documentation for business incorporation and compliance within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) jurisdiction.

The agent leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, using LangChain, Google Gemini, and a FAISS vector store to ensure its analysis is grounded in a specific knowledge base of legal documents.

## Features

- **Intelligent Document Analysis:** Reviews uploaded .docx files for legal red flags, inconsistencies, and missing clauses.
- **RAG-Powered Accuracy:** Uses a local FAISS vector store built from your own legal templates (.docx and .pdf) to provide contextually relevant and accurate analysis.
- **Automated Document Checklist:** Verifies if all mandatory documents are present for specific legal processes (e.g., Company Incorporation).
- **Inline Highlighting & Commenting:** Automatically generates a new .docx file with problematic text highlighted in red and detailed comments added to the relevant paragraphs.
- **Structured Reporting:** Outputs a detailed JSON report summarizing all findings, including document names, issue descriptions, severity, and actionable suggestions.
- **Secure API Key Management:** Uses a .env file to keep your Google API key secure and off version control.
- **Simple Web Interface:** Built with Gradio for easy document uploading and interaction.

## How It Works

1. **Knowledge Base Creation:** The `create_vector_store.py` script reads all .docx and .pdf files from the `templates_for_db` folder, splits them into chunks, and stores their vector embeddings in a local FAISS database. This only needs to be done once or whenever the knowledge base is updated.
2. **Document Upload:** The user uploads one or more .docx files via the Gradio web interface.
3. **Checklist Verification:** The system first checks if all required documents for a given process are present.
4. **RAG-Powered Analysis:** For each document, the system:
   - Retrieves the most relevant text chunks from the FAISS vector store.
   - Sends the document's content along with the retrieved context to the Gemini LLM.
   - Prompts the LLM to identify issues and return a structured JSON object.
5. **Output Generation:** The application generates a downloadable, reviewed .docx file with highlights and comments, alongside a comprehensive JSON report of the findings.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

**For Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install all the required packages from the requirements.txt file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Create the Environment File (Crucial!)
This project uses a `.env` file to manage the Google API Key. This file is not included in the repository and must be created manually.

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and add:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### Step 5: Create and Populate the Knowledge Base Folder
The agent's "knowledge" comes from the documents you provide. This folder is not included in the repository and must be created manually.

In the root of the project directory, create a new folder named `templates_for_db` and copy all your reference ADGM documents (.docx and .pdf files) into it.

### Step 6: Build the Vector Store
Before running the main application, you must process your knowledge base files into a FAISS vector store.

```bash
python create_vector_store.py
```

This will create a `faiss_index` folder in your project directory. Re-run this script if you add, remove, or change files in `templates_for_db`.

### Step 7: Run the Application
Once the vector store is created, launch the Gradio web application.

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Gradio (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) to start using the Corporate Agent.
